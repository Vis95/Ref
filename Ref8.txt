The Staging Area is a sort of a transitions state for files that will be in the directory but still aren't.
You can use it to recap the changes you are about to make (throush status) and make sure you're not making any mistakes or forgetting anything.
It will also probably become useful once you enter the sharing context of GitHub to distinguish between files that are ready to be shared and files who still need work done.
