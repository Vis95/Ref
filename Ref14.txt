For exactly the same reasons you don't want Git to automatically commit your work and more.
If somebody makes a change I might not want it in my code before checking it for myself, and I might not want to share my changes yet.
Also, Git wouldn't know which branch to update to which remote, since both need to be specified, and making that process automated would be more liable to mistakes.
